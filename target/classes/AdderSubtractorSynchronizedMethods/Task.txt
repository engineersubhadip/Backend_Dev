I as a developer have been given a task to write a Count class
So that the object of this class will work perfectly in a Multi-threaded environment.
Meaning the Client should not be worring about the locking mechanisms and all, I should implement them from my Class itself.

We need to make sure, we design incrementValue() and decrementValue() methods in such a way so that 
multiple threads cannot access and update these methods at the same time.
