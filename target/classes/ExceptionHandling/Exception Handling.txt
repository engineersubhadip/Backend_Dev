1. One try can be followed by multiple catch blocks.

2. Catch should be an immediate block after Try.

3. Finally block will be executed, irrespective whether the exception is thrown or not.

Use-case of Finally :-

In normal program, if somewhere in the code failed, the whole program stops.

But if we put try-catch-finally

Then if we encounter an error, then whatever code we have inside Finally, that will still execute.

The finally block will not be executed, only if we close the JVM forcibly.
