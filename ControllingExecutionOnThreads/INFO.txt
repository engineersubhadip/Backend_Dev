In one thread I want to print "hi" and in another thread I want to print "bye".

I want to print "hi" first and then "bye"

I will use Executor Service and leverage the concept of .get().

I will use task1.get() then task2.get().

Meaning, even if the promise of task2 gets resolved first, we are making sure task1 gets executed first.

task1.get();
task2.get();
