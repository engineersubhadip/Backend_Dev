The issue in version 1 is :-
Consider the case of Producers :-
Lets say there are 4 already filled slots and 1 slot is yet to be filled.
T1 and T2 have Producer P1 and P2.

T1 got the CPU Resource :-
T1 read "if (this.slots.size() < maxCap)" i.e. 4 < 5 : TRUE :- T1 gets inside

Context switch 

T2 gets the CPU Resource :-
T2 read "if (this.slots.size() < maxCap)" i.e. 4 < 5 : TRUE :- T2 gets inside.

Context swtich

T1 gets the CPU Resource :-
T1 executed "this.slots.add(this.name);" Now the array size is 5 which is equals to the max Cap.

Context switch

T2 gets the CPU Resource :-
T2 executed "this.slots.add(this.name);" Now the array size is 6 which has execeeded the max Cap.

So, the issue in version1 is :-

1. We are allowing multiple threads concurrently inside the Critical Section. Which is causing Synchronization problem.
