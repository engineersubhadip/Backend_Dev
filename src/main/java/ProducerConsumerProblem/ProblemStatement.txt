In a store there are 5 slots for SHIRTS.

Responsiblity of Producer :- Add a shirt to the slot.
A Producer can only add shirt to the slot if the slot is EMPTY.
A Producer cannot add shirt to the slot is the slot is already FILLED.

Responsibility of Consumer :- Pick a shirt from the slot.
A Consumer can pick shirt from a slot if it is FILLED.
A Consumer cannot pick shirt from a slot if it is EMPTY.

Number of concurrent PRODUCERS in a Store can be = Number of Empty Slots.
Number of concurrent CONSUMERS in the Store can be = Number of FILLED Slots.

Lets say the max capacity of slots in the Store is 5.
Initially the number of Empty slots in the store is 5 -> We can allow 5 producers to come in.
Initially the number of Filled slots in the store is 0 -> We can allow 0 consumers to come in.
