1. Class A has name = "Subhadip".

2. Class B is inheriting from Class A and name = "Das"

3. B b = new B(); {Meaning the object of Class B should refer to the properties of Class B}

4. b.name -> Das

5. Now inside Class B, I want to use the value of Class A

Class B extends A {
	String name = "Das";
	
	public void getParentData() {
		print(super.name);
	}
}

Using "super" refers to the parent class.

6. Invoke the Parent Class Constructor From the Child Class

class A {
	public A(){print"Inside Parent Constructor"};
}

class B extends A {
	public B () {
		super();
		print("Inside Child Class Constructor");
	}
}
