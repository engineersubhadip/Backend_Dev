We are using SEMAPHORES to add concurrent threads to enter into the Store.

Whenever we have shared Data Structure between multiple threads.
Meaning multiple threads are trying to access/modify the Shared Data Structure.
ALWAYS USE CONCURRENT VERSION OF THE DATA STRUCTURE.

CRUX :-
Using Semaphores you let concurrent Threads to enter into the Store.
But using locks/synchronized you let them add/remove items from the Store
